# sort-imports

Sort ES6 imports automatically. Ported from the [atom-import-sort](https://atom.io/packages/atom-import-sort) package by [Renke Grunwald](https://github.com/renke).

## Features

Automatically sorts imports on save. You can disable this behavior in the settings and sort imports manually:

1. Launch the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`);
2. Enter **Sort imports**

You can also save the document without saving imports. This could become handy when you have auto saving enabled, but don't want to sort the imports in a particular file:

1. Launch the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`);
2. Enter **Save file without sorting imports**

## Extension Settings

This extension has the following setting:

* `sortImports.onSave`: enable/disable auto sorting on save (default: enabled)
