# sort-imports

Sort ES6 imports for JavaScript and TypeScript automatically.
Ported from the [atom-import-sort](https://atom.io/packages/atom-import-sort) package by [Renke Grunwald](https://github.com/renke).

## Features

Automatically sorts imports on save. You can disable this behavior in the settings and sort imports manually:

1. Launch the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`);
1. Enter **Sort imports**

You can also save the document without saving imports. This could become handy when you have auto saving enabled, but don't want to sort the imports in a particular file:

1. Launch the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`);
1. Enter **Save file without sorting imports**

## Extension Settings

This extension has the following settings:

* `sort-imports.on-save`: enable/disable auto sorting on save (default: true).
* `sort-imports.suppress-warnings`: suppress warnings if sorting imports fails (default: false).
* `sort-imports.languages`: selectively choose the languages which should be sported (default: ['javascript', 'typescript']).
* `sort-imports.blank-lines-after`: number of blank linkes after the imports (default: 0). Set to 0 to disable the feature.
* `sort-imports.sort-type`: two sorting modes are provided: `by-module-name` (default) and `by-imported-name`.
  * `by-module-name` will sort imports by the imported path. This is the default setting.
  * `by-imported-name` will sort the imports by the first imported identifier.
