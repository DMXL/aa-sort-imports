Maintained by [A. Mat√≠as Quezada](https://github.com/amatiasq)

## Features

Automatically sorts imports on save. You can disable this behavior in the settings and sort imports manually:

1. Launch the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`);
1. Enter **Sort imports**

You can also save the document without saving imports. This could become handy when you have auto saving enabled, but don't want to sort the imports in a particular file:

1. Launch the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`);
1. Enter **Save file without sorting imports**

## Extension Settings

This extension has the following settings:

* `sort-imports.on-save`: enable/disable auto sorting on save (default: true)
* `sort-imports.languages`: selectively choose the languages which should be sported (default: ['javascript', 'typescript'])
